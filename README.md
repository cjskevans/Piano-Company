# Piano-Company
This is a project that implements a postgresql database for a piano company, as well as a java program that interfaces with that database to 
sell pianos to customers or lookup pianos. It works by using a java program to create a GUI to log into the sql server, and it creates a command line prompt 
which the user will then select which operation they want to do, either looking up a piano by make and model, or selling a piano to a customer. 
The project_charlieevans.sql has the sql code for the backend, and Main.java has the java program. It is prepopulated with data.
